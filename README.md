# AcmRank

This is an app using [uhunt](uhunt.felix-halim.net) api (using the [kaspars/hunter](https://github.com/kasparsklavins/Hunter) lib) to view problem solving standing on colleagues and try to motivate students on competitive problem solving

## Usage
Install composer and then run
`composer install`

## To-Do

1. Store data in a database to avoid too many Curl operations (time consuming operation).
2. Preview last week changes (like, X go one positi√≥n up in the ranking).
3. Add a global, yearly and weekly rankings.
4. Add an university flag (for different colleagues students)

## Future ideas

1. Add a point-based ranking and quest funcionality
2. Add support for [live-archive?](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/)
